Hi everyone, my name is Dan McKeown. I am actually a faculty member here are UMass - Lowell where I teach full-time in the United States Air Force's Reserve Officer Training Corps program. My team and I prepare college students to serve as officers in the US Air Force or Space Force.

I am married and have three kids aged 17 to 5 and am originally from Massachusetts so it's nice being stationed in a place so close to where I grew up. 

I've always wanted to learn to code and figured taking a class would keep me accountable. :) My goal for this class is to build a foundation for future programming courses/languages. I've heard that learning the C-language is similar to learning how to drive on a manual versus automatic transmission. 

I look forward to interacting with everyone over the next few weeks.
